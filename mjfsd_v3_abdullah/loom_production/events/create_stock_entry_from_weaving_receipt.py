def create_manufacture_stock_entry(weaving_receipt):
	"""Called from Weaving Receipt's on_submit. Raises ONE Manufacture
	Stock Entry for the whole document: one raw-material consumption row
	per (Weaving Receipt Item row x matching Towel Costing Sheet Materials
	row), plus one finished-item row per Weaving Receipt Item row.

	Per Kabeer's choice when asked: raw materials are taken literally from
	the Towel Costing Sheet's own Materials table (the raw yarn item, no
	Beam-item substitution for Pile/Ground - unlike Daily Towel
	Production), and ratio/weaving-wastage% are read fresh from that same
	Towel Costing Sheet rather than from the Weaving Contract's BOM Items.

	2026-09-15 (feature v3) update:
	- Consumed qty now uses Weight Actual (Lbs) instead of Weight (Actual)
	  kg ("yarn consumed qty is incorrect, just use the weight actual
	  (Lbs) now instead of weight actual" - your words).
	- The finished item row's basic_rate is now set explicitly:
	  (Total Outgoing Value + (Weight Actual (Lbs) x Rate)) / Finish Qty,
	  where Rate = the Weaving Contract's Weaving Rate Per Lbs.
	- The finished item row also gets the new Per LBS Rate custom field:
	  (Total Outgoing Value / Weight Actual (Lbs)) + Rate.
	  "Total Outgoing Value" is this Weaving Receipt Item row's own
	  attributable raw-material consumption value (self-contained per
	  row, not a blended total shared across unrelated finish items in
	  the same Stock Entry).

	2026-09-15 fix #1: restored the finished row's `batch_no` (= Greige
	Batch from the matching Sales Order Item, only when the Finish Item
	is batch-tracked) - this had been dropped by a rebuild from a stale
	local copy. Without it, submitting against a batch-tracked Finish
	Item fails with "Serial No / Batch No are mandatory for Item ...".

	2026-09-15 fix #2 (this fix): "Total Outgoing Value" used to be
	computed independently here via a Bin valuation-rate lookup at the
	time each raw-material row was appended. That guess can diverge from
	the rate Frappe's own valuation engine actually posts onto those rows
	during validate() (moving-average/FIFO timing, precision, etc.) -
	which is exactly what caused the Basic Rate / Per LBS Rate mismatch
	you reported (your worked example: 19965.40/100 + 55.115x45/100 =
	224.4, but the posted values didn't match that).

	Fixed by NOT setting any rate on the raw-material rows and letting
	Frappe compute them itself during se.insert(). Frappe mutates the
	same Python row objects in place, so right after insert() we read
	back each row's real `.amount` (this IS what "Total Outgoing Value"
	shows on the Stock Entry) and use THAT - not a separate guess - to
	compute the finished row's basic_rate and Per LBS Rate.

	2026-09-15 fix #3: fix #2 above then called se.save() (a second,
	separate validate pass) to bake the finished row's real basic_rate in
	before submit - and that's what you hit next ("total incoming value
	is 0"). Rather than trust that second validate() to also rewrite
	`amount`/`basic_amount` from the new `basic_rate` on its own,
	`amount`/`basic_amount` are now set explicitly ourselves right next to
	`basic_rate`, and the redundant se.save() is dropped entirely -
	se.submit() is called directly (submit() runs validate() itself, so
	nothing is lost, there's just one fewer round trip that could silently
	leave amount stale).

	2026-09-15 fix #4: the Stock Entry itself now also gets
	`custom_weaving_receipt` set (new parent-level Stock Entry custom
	field, see mjfsd_v3_abdullah/custom/stock_entry.json) - "why are there no
	references of documents in stock entry" - so opening the Stock Entry
	on its own shows which Weaving Receipt created it, not just the
	per-row plumbing fields.
