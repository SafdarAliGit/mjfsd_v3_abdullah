# On Dyeing Receipt submit: one Repack Stock Entry, consuming each row's
# Greige batch and producing the same Item under its Color batch - "finish
# will be color batch item" / "finish qty will be received qty and finish
# rate will be valuation rate of greige + rate" (your words).
#
# 2026-09-14 update: also enforces "the received values shouldn't be
# greater than the issued values" (your words) for Pcs, Rolls AND Weight -
# checked against the matching Dyeing Contract Item's accumulated Issued
# totals, right before the Repack entry is created (so a violation blocks
# the whole submit, nothing partially posts). Also rolls up Rolls/Weight
# Received into the Dyeing Contract Item + Dyeing Contract, alongside the
# existing Pcs rollup.
#
# 2026-09-15 (feature v3) update: also sets the new Per LBS Rate custom
# field on the finish (Color Batch) row - (Total Outgoing Value / Weight
# Actual (Lbs)) + Rate. "Total Outgoing Value" is this row's own Greige
# consumption (received_qty x greige rate) - each Dyeing Receipt Item row
# is a self-contained Greige-in/Color-out pair, so that's the value
# actually attributable to that row's own finish output, not a blended
# total shared across unrelated rows in the same Stock Entry. Flag this
# interpretation to Kabeer if he meant the whole Stock Entry's total
# instead.
#
# 2026-09-15 fix (same class of bug reported on Weaving Receipt's
# Manufacture Stock Entry): the greige row's basic_rate used to be set
# here via an independent Bin valuation-rate lookup, and that guess can
# diverge from the rate Frappe's own valuation engine actually posts onto
# the row during validate() (moving-average/FIFO timing, precision,
# etc.) - even though set_basic_rate_manually wasn't set on that row, so
# Frappe could silently recompute/overwrite it anyway, leaving the finish
# row's "greige_rate + Rate" built on a number that no longer matched what
# actually posted. Fixed the same way: the greige row is now appended
# with NO rate set, se.insert() lets Frappe compute its real basic_rate,
# and only THEN do we read that back to work out the finish row's
# basic_rate and Per LBS Rate - not a separate guess.
#
# 2026-09-15 fix #2 (same day, applied proactively after the equivalent
# bug was actually reported on Weaving Receipt - "total incoming value is
# 0"): amount/basic_amount on the finish row are now set explicitly right
# alongside basic_rate, and the redundant se.save() before submit was
# dropped in favour of calling se.submit() directly (it runs validate()
# itself). Also tags the Stock Entry itself with custom_dyeing_receipt /
# custom_dyeing_contract (new parent-level Stock Entry custom fields, see
# mjfsd_v3_abdullah/custom/stock_entry.json) so the Stock Entry shows what created it
# without having to dig into its row-level plumbing fields.
#
# 2026-09-16 fix: the finish row's basic_rate used to be
# `greige_rate + row.rate` - but row.rate is a rate PER LBS (fetched from
# the Dyeing Contract), so that was adding a per-lbs currency figure
# straight onto a per-piece rate ("rates mentioned in dyeing contract are
# rate per LBS, I don't want that exact value to be added in items value"
# - your words). Fixed to convert it to a per-piece figure first:
# (Weight (kg) (Received) x 2.2046 x Rate) / Received Qty, added onto the
# greige rate. Also now copies Rolls (Received) / Weight (kg) (Received) /
# Weight (Lbs) onto the finish row's custom_no_of_rolls / custom_weight_kgs
# / custom_total_lbs (Stock Entry Detail custom fields) - these were being
# computed but never actually written onto the Stock Entry's own rows.
