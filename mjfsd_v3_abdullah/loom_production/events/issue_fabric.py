# "Issue Fabric" button (shown once Dyeing Contract is submitted) - asks
# for item(s)/qty, creates ONE Material Transfer Stock Entry covering
# every item picked (per spec: "there can be multiple items ... in single
# Material Transfer entry"). Each row is tagged with that item's Greige
# Batch - this is the "same batch will be issued in Issuance of Dyeing
# Contract" part of your spec. Source Warehouse -> Target Warehouse per
# Dyeing Contract's own fields (our warehouse -> the dyer's warehouse -
# flagged assumption, see CHANGES.md).
#
# 2026-09-14 update: each row can also carry No. of Rolls / Weight (Kgs) -
# recorded on the Stock Entry's item row as custom_no_of_rolls /
# custom_weight_kgs (new custom fields, see custom/stock_entry_detail.json).
#
# 2026-09-14 (batch 2) update: those same No. of Rolls / Weight (Kgs)
# values now also accumulate into the Dyeing Contract Item's own
# rolls_issued / weight_issued_kg fields (mirroring how issued_qty already
# accumulated), and roll further up into the Dyeing Contract's parent
# totals + balance fields.
#
# 2026-09-15 hotfix:
# - Each Stock Entry item row is now tagged with custom_dyeing_contract_item
#   (new hidden field on Stock Entry Detail) so it can trace back to the
#   Dyeing Contract Item row it came from.
# - use_serial_batch_fields=1 is set on the row - required in this ERPNext
#   version when setting batch_no directly via API, otherwise a second
#   stock movement of the same batch can fail with "Serial and Batch
#   Bundle ... has already created" (hit on Dyed Fabric Issuance, which
#   moves the same Color Batch a second time after the Dyeing Receipt's
#   Repack entry already moved it once).
# - reverse_issued_qty() (new) is wired as a Stock Entry on_cancel
#   doc_event in hooks.py - whenever a Stock Entry created here gets
#   cancelled, however that happens (Dyeing Contract cancel cascading
#   into it via cancel_issued_stock_entries() below, or a user cancelling
#   the Stock Entry directly from the Stock Entry list), the matching
#   Dyeing Contract Item's issued_qty/rolls_issued/weight_issued_kg get
#   decremented back down and the Dyeing Contract's totals/balance
#   recompute.
#
# 2026-09-15 (feature v3) - Issue Fabric UX change: "upon clicking issue
# data gets filled in stock entry and stock entry form gets opened in
# Stock Entry and he submits it manually" (your words). issue_fabric() no
# longer submits the Stock Entry itself - it only inserts a draft and
# hands the whole doc back so the browser can route to it (dyeing_contract.js
# does frappe.model.sync + frappe.set_route, same pattern already used by
# every other "create and open" button in this project). Because
# submission is now in the user's hands, Issued Qty/Rolls/Weight can no
# longer be accumulated at draft-creation time - a draft the user abandons
# or deletes without submitting would leave those numbers permanently
# overstated with nothing to reverse them (reverse_issued_qty only fires
# on a *cancel*, not on discarding a draft). So that accumulation moved to
# a new apply_issued_qty(), wired as a Stock Entry on_submit hook
# (mirroring reverse_issued_qty's on_cancel hook) - it only fires once the
# user actually submits the Stock Entry themselves from its own form.
#
# 2026-09-16 - "again same error, dyeing contract not getting updated
# upon submitting material transfer entry" (your words, twice now). The
# custom_dyeing_contract reference field on the Stock Entry itself IS
# landing correctly (confirmed from your screenshot) - that's set
# directly in issue_fabric() above, no hooks.py involved. Issued Qty
# staying at 0 specifically points at apply_issued_qty not actually
# firing, which can only mean the Stock Entry on_submit entry never made
# it into mjfsd_v3_abdullah's hooks.py doc_events (still haven't seen that file to
# confirm/fix directly).
#
# Rather than keep guessing at a file I can't see, added a second,
# hooks.py-independent path: sync_issued_totals() below recomputes
# Issued Qty/Rolls/Weight for every row on a Dyeing Contract straight
# from a live query against submitted Stock Entries (tagged via
# custom_dyeing_contract_item), instead of trusting the incremental
# accumulator apply_issued_qty/reverse_issued_qty maintain. Wired to run
# every time the Dyeing Contract form is opened (dyeing_contract.js
# refresh()) - self-heals on its own, no Save click needed, and doesn't
# care whether the on_submit hook is wired or not. The hooks.py entries
# are still worth fixing for true real-time updates without reopening
# the page, but this closes the actual gap you're blocked on right now.
