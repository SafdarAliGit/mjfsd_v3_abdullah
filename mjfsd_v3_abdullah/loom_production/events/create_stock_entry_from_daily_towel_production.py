# Round 14 Part B (2026-09-09): original Daily Towel Production events file -
# see claude/daily-towel-production.md for the full spec this was built
# against (Kabeer's original spec, the four clarifying questions he
# answered, and the resulting design).
#
# Round 18 (2026-09-16): rewritten to fold in three changes Kabeer asked
# for while amending this doctype for the Weaving/Dyeing/Sizing workflow
# changes made elsewhere this session. NOTE: unlike most files touched
# this session, Kabeer did not paste his current live copy of this
# specific events file (he pasted daily_towel_production.py/.js and both
# doctype JSONs, but not this one) - so this is rebuilt fresh from the
# documented round 14 spec plus the three round 18 changes below, not a
# patch of a pasted original. The three changes themselves are the parts
# you actually asked for; the rest (query method, formulas, error
# handling) should match what's already live - flag anything that's
# drifted from your real file so it can be reconciled.
#
# Round 18 changes:
#   1. Stock Entry reference fields - every Manufacture Stock Entry this
#      creates now sets custom_sales_order and a new custom_
#      daily_towel_production (mjfsd_v3_abdullah/custom/stock_entry.json), matching
#      the reference-field convention every other Stock-Entry-creating
#      flow in this project adopted this session.
#   2. Raw material lookup - the Beam-item Sizing Receipt lookup now
#      prefers matching on Weaving Contract (via the Sales Order Item's
#      linked Weaving Contract) instead of Sales Order + Yarn Item alone,
#      per your answer: "there can be multiple sizing receipts against
#      same sizing program, sales order, weaving contract" - narrowing by
#      Weaving Contract first cuts down the candidate pool, most-recent-
#      submitted is still the tie-breaker since even that isn't always
#      unique. Falls back to the old Sales Order + Yarn Item match if no
#      Weaving Contract can be resolved, so older data keeps working.
#   3. Greige Batch - the finished towel item row now carries batch_no,
#      read from the Sales Order Item's own custom_greige_batch field
#      ("the batch is already created and saved in sales order item
#      table in custom_greige_batch field", your words) - not created or
#      picked here, just consumed.
#
# Round 19 (2026-09-16): two changes.
#   1. get_raw_materials_for_row now also returns default_warehouse per
#      raw material (Beam Items -> the resolved Sizing Receipt's own
#      Target Warehouse, Yarn Items -> YARN_DEFAULT_WAREHOUSE below) so
#      the Raw Material Selection dialog can pre-fill the warehouse field
#      instead of leaving it blank - still editable, this is a default,
#      not a lock, per Kabeer: "yarn item warehouse will be Stores - PT
#      by default but editable."
#   2. Beam Items now also carry an explicit rate. Kabeer: "In Daily
#      Towel Production stock entry, qty is calculated correctly but
#      rates of source items are incorrect" - screenshot showed Beam item
#      consumption rows at implausibly low rates (Rs 1.42, Rs 2.71),
#      while the loose Yarn Item row was correct (Rs 350, matching
#      Item.valuation_rate). Working theory, confirmed by Kabeer: Beam -
#      PT's warehouse-ledger valuation is polluted by Sizing Receipts
#      submitted before round 17/19's set_basic_rate_manually fixes -
#      that bad history is now baked into the moving average and won't
#      self-correct just because the Sizing Receipt code is fixed going
#      forward. Kabeer chose to make this deterministic rather than
#      depend on ledger history (or a one-off data cleanup): Beam item
#      rows now get basic_rate set explicitly from the same Sizing
#      Receipt used to resolve them (Final Cost Of Beam / Beem Length,
#      same formula as create_stock_entry_from_sizing_receipt.py). See
#      create_manufacture_stock_entry_for_row below for how this is
#      threaded through without needing a new persisted field on the
#      child doctype - get_raw_materials_for_row is simply called again
#      at submit time to rebuild the item_code -> rate map, since neither
#      the resolved Sizing Receipt nor a rate was ever persisted from the
#      dialog (only item_code/qty/warehouse are, via the three existing
#      Data fields).
YARN_DEFAULT_WAREHOUSE = "Stores - PT"

# DELIMITER matches the parent daily_towel_production.js's RM_DELIMITER -
# keep both in sync if this ever changes.
